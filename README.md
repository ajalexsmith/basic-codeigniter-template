# basic-codeigniter-template

A quick and easy way to setup a website. The default design is a one-page layout with different sections. Sections will be pulled from a database and can be edited from an admin area on the site.

## Changes: 
  - Login page has been created (Mode, Controller and View). 
  - Login controller has a commented out line to add a user to the database.
  - Default route changed to home (doesn't exist yet).
  - Database details added to 'database.php'.
  - Added modules to 'autoload.php'.
  - File created in root of SQL commands to run on the database.
